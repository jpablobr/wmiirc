=== Version 4.1.1 (2011-03-28)

This release fixes bugs in the inward & outward automated client arrangements.

=== Version 4.1.0 (2011-03-28)

This release adds new automated client arrangements and cleans up the code.

.New features

- Added new automated client arrangements:

  * `Rumai::View#tile_left()` - Horizontal mirror of the LarsWM arrangement.

  * `Rumai::View#tile_leftward()` - Imagine an equilateral triangle with its
    base on the left side of the screen and its peak on the right side of the
    screen.

  * `Rumai::View#tile_rightward()` - Imagine an equilateral triangle with its
    base on the right side of the screen and its peak on the left side of the
    screen.

  * `Rumai::View#tile_inward()` - Imagine two equilateral triangles with
    their bases on the left and right sides of the screen and their peaks
    meeting in the middle of the screen.

  * `Rumai::View#tile_outward()` - Imagine two equilateral triangles
    with their bases meeting in the middle of the screen and their peaks
    reaching outward to the left and right sides of the screen.

- Renamed existing automated client arrangement method names:

  * `Rumai::View#arrange_as_larswm()` is now aliased to `tile_right()`
  * `Rumai::View#arrange_in_diamond()` is now aliased to `tile_inward()`
  * `Rumai::View#arrange_in_stacks()` is now aliased to `stack()`

This release fixes a bug regarding the `$WMII_ADDRESS` environment variable.

.Incompatible changes

* `Rumai::Area#push()`, `#insert()`, and `#unshift()` methods no longer accept
  an Array object as an argument.  If you still wish to pass an Array, then
  use the splat operator to pass the contents of your Array to these methods.
+
Thanks to Mattia Gheda for reporting
http://github.com/sunaku/rumai/issues/10[this issue].

* Add 'amount' parameter to `Rumai::Client#nudge()` and `#grow()`.

+
Thanks to OneLastTry for reporting
http://github.com/sunaku/rumai/issues/9[this issue].

* Fix parsing of area IDs from view manifest when *witray* is present.

=== Version 3.3.1 (2010-08-11)

This release fixes a bug regarding the `$WMII_ADDRESS` environment variable.

.Bug fixes

* Fix incorrect syntax when amending error message about the `$WMII_ADDRESS`
  environment variable not being set.

.Housekeeping

* Dump 9P2000 packets if `$VERBOSE`, not if `$DEBUG`, in unit tests.

* Upgrade to Inochi 5.0.2; the help manual is now written in AsciiDoc.

=== Version 3.3.0 (2010-07-16)

This release adds support for growing and nudging clients, adds an
abstraction for status bar applets, and beautifies the source code.

.New features

* Add `Rumai::Barlet` class for easier status bar applets.  It exposes the
  new, independent `colors` and `label` attributes introduced into the bar
  file format by wmii-hg2743.  It is also backwards-compatible with older
  wmii versions where the aforementioned attributes were conjoined.

* Add `Rumai::Client#grow` and `Rumai::Client#nudge` methods
  http://github.com/sunaku/rumai/issues/6[requested by Nathan Neff].
  See "The /tag/ Hierarchy" in the wmii manpage for usage information.

.Bug fixes

* Add workaround for the
  http://code.google.com/p/wmii/issues/detail?id=206[wmii-hg2734 color tuple
  bug] in the test suite.

.Housekeeping

This release adds a UNIX manual page and requires wmii 3.9 or newer.

.Bug fixes

* `Rumai::Area#unshift` needs wmii 3.9 or newer.  The help manual has been
  corrected accordingly.
+
Thanks to Mattia Gheda for reporting
http://github.com/sunaku/wmiirc/issues/8[this issue].

.Housekeeping

* Upgrade to Inochi 3.0.0.  Run `rumai --help` to see the UNIX manual page!

* Move IRB session creation code from rumai(1) into `rumai/irb` sub-library.

=== Version 3.2.2 (2010-04-01)

This release fixes some warnings that appeared during installation and
performs some minor housekeeping.

.Bug fixes

* Warnings of the following form appeared during gem installation:
+
  Unrecognized directive '...' in lib/rumai/inochi.yaml
+
Thanks to Mattia Gheda for reporting this.

.Housekeeping

* Upgrade to Inochi 2.0.0-rc2 for managing this project.

=== Version 3.2.1 (2010-03-22)

This release improves multi-threading support in Rumai's pure-Ruby
implementation of the <<libixp, IXP file-system interface>>.

.Thank you

* Kenneth De Winter reported the issue of status bar applets not refreshing
  according to their prescribed schedule (this is particularly noticable
  in the clock applet) and verified my fix for the problem.

.Bug fixes

* Perform a blocking I/O read to recieve a 9P2000 message in
  `Rumai::IXP::Agent#recv` only if recieve buffer is empty.  This gives
  other threads a chance to check the recieve buffer for their response.
  instead of being blocked by us as we greedily hold on to the 9P2000
  message stream until our expected response arrives.

.Housekeeping

* Upgrade to Inochi 2.0.0-rc1 and Dfect 2.0.0.

=== Version 3.2.0 (2009-11-17)

This release adds a new automated view arrangement, simplifies the IXP
transport layer, and cleans up the code and API documentation.

.New features

* Add `Rumai::View#arrange_in_stacks` automated view arrangement.

* Convert `:stack` and `:max` arguments into wmii 3.9 syntax in
  `Rumai::Area#layout=`.

.Bug fixes

* Rewrote IXP transport layer (`Rumai::IXP::Agent`) to _not_ use a
  background thread, according to <<XCB-cookies, the XCB cookie approach>>.

.Housekeeping

* Clean up some code and API docs.

* Reduce amount of string concatenation in `Struct#to_9p`.

=== Version 3.1.1 (2009-11-16)

This release fixes bugs in automated view arrangements and updates the user
manual.

.Bug fixes

* The relative order of clients was not being preserved during view
  arrangements.
+
Thanks to Nathan Neff for reporting this bug.

* Focus on the current view was lost after automated view arrangement was
  applied if the current view was not the first view on which the initially
  focused (before the automated arrangement was applied) client appeared.

=== Version 3.1.0 (2009-10-02)

This release adds new methods, fixes some bugs, and revises the manual.

.New features

* Add `Client#float` methods to manipulate floating status.

* Add `Client#manage` methods to manipulate managed status.

* The `Client#tags=` method now accepts '~' and '!' tag prefixes.

.Bug fixes

* There is no `View#move_focus` method, only `View#select`.

* Assertion failure in test suite because all files in `/rbar`
  (inside wmii's IXP filesystem) contain an automatic color header when
  read.

.Housekeeping

* Use simpler Copyright reminder at the top of every file.

* Open source is for fun, so speak of "related works", not "competitors".

=== Version 3.0.0 (2009-05-11)

This release revises method names, adds new methods, and fixes a bug.

.Incompatible changes

* Rename `#toggle_` methods to use `!` suffix in their names.

* Rename `#float` methods to `#floating`.

* Rename `View#floater` method to `View#floating_area`.

.New features

* Add `Client#stick` methods to manipulate sticky status.

* Add `Client#fullscreen` methods to manipulate fullscreen status.

* Add `Client#slay` method which is a forceful version of `#kill`.

* Add `View#select` method to move focus relatively inside a view.

* Add `Area::floating` method for symmetry with `Area::curr`.

* Add `View#managed_area` aliases for `View#column` methods.

.Bug fixes

* Fix error when unzooming clients from temporary view.

* Fix code that launches temporary terminals in the Tutorial.
+
Use the `/bin/sh` version of the read(1) command for portability.

.Housekeeping

* Use `Client#send` instead of `#swap` in automated arrangements because
  it causes less traffic on /event/.

* Add old release notes from blog to user manual.

=== Version 2.1.0 (2009-05-09)

This release improves client arrangement, fixes several bugs, and cleans up
the code.

.Thank you

* Simon Hafner reported several bugs.
* Michael Andrus verified bug fixes.

.New features

* Focus is now restored on the initially focused client after applying
  automated client arrangements.

* The `push()`, `insert()`, and `unshift()` instance methods of the
  `Rumai::Area` class now preserve the order of inserted clients.

* The `Rumai::View#arrange_in_grid()` method now accepts 1 as a parameter.
  This invocation causes every column to contain at most 1 client.

.Bug fixes

* Fix error caused by focusing the top/bottom client in the destination
  area before sending new clients into that area.

* Fix error when importing clients into an empty area.

.Housekeeping

* Use snake_case instead of camelCase for variable names.

=== Version 2.0.2 (2009-02-26)

This release fixes a connection bug.

.Bug fixes

* wmii omits the fractional portion of `$DISPLAY` in its socket file path.
  Rumai was trying to connect with the entire `$DISPLAY` value (including
  the fractional portion) and thus could not find wmii's socket file.
+
Thanks to Simon Hafner for reporting this bug.

=== Version 2.0.1 (2009-01-25)

This release simplifies project administrivia using <<Inochi>>, improves the
unit tests, and revises the user manual.

.Bug fixes

* The `rumai/ixp/message` library's unit test failed if
  `/rbar/status` did not already exist in wmii.

.Housekeeping

* Store IXP socket address in `Rumai::IXP_SOCK_ADDR`.

* Added missing test cases for (TR)create and (TR)remove messages in the
  unit test for the `rumai/ixp/message` library.

=== Version 2.0.0 (2008-02-04)

This release adds support for wmii 3.6, improves the performance of the IXP
library, and fixes some bugs.

.Thank you

* Christoph Blank tested Rumai 1.0.0 under wmii 3.6 and reported bugs.

.Incompatible changes

  by `Rumai::IXP::Agent::FidStream#read(true)` for efficiency.

* The `Rumai::IXP::Agent::FidStream#write` method no longer writes to
  the beginning of the stream. Instead, it writes to the current position
  in the stream.

* The `Rumai::View#floating_area` method has been renamed to
  `Rumai::View#floater` for brevity.

.New features

* Added several more methods (such as `rewind`, `pos=`, `eof?`, and so on)
  from Ruby's IO class to the `Rumai::IXP::Agent::FidStream` class.

* Added the `Rumai::Client#kill` method to simplify client termination.

.Bug fixes

* Fixed a race condition in `Rumai::Agent#talk` which would cause Rumai to
  hang when multiple threads used it.

=== Version 1.0.0 (2008-01-26)

This is the first release of Rumai, the evolution of
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.wmii/1704[wmii-irb], which
lets you manipulate the <<wmii>> window manager through <<Ruby>>.  Enjoy!
